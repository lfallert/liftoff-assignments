# Project Outline
For this assignment, you will submit a high-level outline of your project. This can, and likely will, change over time. In particular, your mentor will provide direction and feedback to help sharpen your ideas. So don't worry if you feel unsure about some aspects of the outline or if you have to change some things later.

## Submission Instructions

### Overview
Have you ever had that feeling of missing out, or “FOMO”, on a Saturday, wondering what events might be going on that you don’t know about? That feeling is what inspired our newest app. We are creating the “go-to” app in the community to discover events in one’s current area. This app will allow the user to find events that interest them by utilizing a search engine that sorts events by tags and locations. Our goal is for users to be search for these events in just one spot, rather than scouring many different websites.

### Features
Create Event – Users with specific authorization will be able to create events. Name, Date, Description, Location, Cost

Edit Event – Users with specific authorization will be able to edit event attributes.

Search with Filter for Event – A search engine that allows for specific keywords or filters so a user can look for the events that they are interested in.

User login + Authorization – Users will be able to create accounts (event searchers and event planners) and log in to type of their account. Each user will have a unique profile page with their saved events or events they have created.

Favorite Events – Event searchers will be able to save and view events to their profile (notifications will pop up for the user when events are coming up – see things we have to learn)

Display Events- The user will be able to view events according to their specific search or location. This will utilize an Interactive Mapping API

### Technologies
Java
mySQL
Springboot
Hibernate
Thymeleaf  
Angular

### What I'll Have to Learn
OAuth – We are looking into using Spring security OAuth in order to protect user information via third party

Interactive Mapping API – We looking into Google Maps API or Yelp API so a user on our app can look for events in their area 

Web scraper – We are looking into implementing a web scraper to pull specific events from different websites

Event Authentication – We are working on a way for events to be authenticated as real, possibly by only allowing those with the correct event authorization (event planners) to create/edit events. We could also have a mod system/admin role in place.

Notifications – This would alert a user with a profile of upcoming events in their area. We will need to do more research in how to implement this.
